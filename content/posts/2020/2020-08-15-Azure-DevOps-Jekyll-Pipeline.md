    Setting Up an Azure DevOps Build Pipeline for a Jekyll Website on Azure Blob
    Storage
---

If anyone wants to deploy a website using Azure DevOps this should build the site. It took a while to get just right. The tricky parts were azcopy being version 7 on the Ubuntu machine which is awful as far as I can tell, version 10 is much better, so I had to do some wonky stuff. It also purges the cache on the CDN I host from in Azure so that the site gets an HTTPS cert. I might expand this post over the next few weeks, or explain the entire setup process to host a site on Azure Blob Storage as a Static Site. The main benefit is the cost, the last week of hosting this has cost Â£0.02 so far! Not bad for a full site with an HTTPS cert in place.

Anyway, this is the pipeline YAML file I ended up with. Generate a SAS token and place its value as a variable called 'sastoken' and your own subscription for the purging the cache step.

```yaml
trigger:
    - master

pool:
    vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"

steps:
    - task: UseRubyVersion@0
      inputs:
          versionSpec: ">= 2.6"

    - script: |
          gem install jekyll bundler
          bundle install --retry=3 --jobs=4
      displayName: "Install Jekyll"

    - script: |
          bundle install
          jekyll -v
          jekyll build
      displayName: "Build Jekyll Site"

    - task: PowerShell@2
      inputs:
          targetType: "inline"
          script: |
              wget -O azcopy_v10.tar.gz https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy-v10-linux && tar -xf azcopy_v10.tar.gz --strip-components=1
              mv azcopy azcopy10
              azcopy10 --version
              azcopy10 sync "./_site/" "https://rootisgodstaticwebsite.blob.core.windows.net/`$web$env:SASTOKEN" --delete-destination true
          displayName: "Update Static Site Blob"
      env:
          SASTOKEN: $(sastoken)

    - task: AzureCLI@2
      inputs:
          azureSubscription: "Put in your subscription"
          scriptType: "bash"
          scriptLocation: "inlineScript"
          inlineScript: 'az cdn endpoint purge --resource-group "www.rootisgod.com" --name "rootisgod" --profile-name "rootisgod-cdn" --content-paths "/*"'
      displayName: "Purge CDN Cache"
```
