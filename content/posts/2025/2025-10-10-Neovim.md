If you aren't aware, the new hotness is Neovim and Omarchy. The days of minimalist coding and retro looking UI's are back!

And it is glorious.

To note, I don't ahve an Omarchy install or a Framework laptop (yet!) but I do have a Mac and thought perhaps I could learn Neovim (and Lazyvim, more later) then when I do move to Omarchy, it will be a cinch!

## Neovim

Neovim is 'new vim'. I never used old vim, but have to admit to getting swept up in this year of the Linux desktop.

To install on mac;

```bash
brew install neovim
```

Then, git clone this repo. Don't think, just run it! It is a config which contains lots of plugins for Neovim and makes it almost like an OS inside a text editor. This puts it in your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim
```

Then run this

```bash
nvim
```

Then behold a screen of magic, where hundreds of things install.

It's a lot to take in, but from now on, the SPACE key is your best friend.
