# MultiManage

I've posted before about Multipass [https://www.rootisgod.com/2022/Using-Multipass-Like-a-Personal-Cloud-Service/](https://www.rootisgod.com/2022/Using-Multipass-Like-a-Personal-Cloud-Service/) and always felt it was a great way to get a cloud style Linux instance up and running quickly. I was also looking to try and learn a bit of Python. So, after a couple months of hacking away at a program that works for Mac, Windows and Linux (massively helped by [PySimpleGUI](https://www.pysimplegui.org/)) I think it is probably ready to see if anyone else could make use of it.

The [readme](https://github.com/rootisgod/MultiManage#readme) on this GitHub repo should explain the general setup in more detail. The short story is that it lets you create and manage instances without having to drop down to the command line. I hope someone finds it useful!
