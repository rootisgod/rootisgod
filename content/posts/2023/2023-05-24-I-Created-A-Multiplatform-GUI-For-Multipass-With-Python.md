I've posted before about Multipass [https://www.rootisgod.com/2022/Using-Multipass-Like-a-Personal-Cloud-Service/](https://www.rootisgod.com/2022/Using-Multipass-Like-a-Personal-Cloud-Service/) and always felt it was a great way to get a cloud style Linux instance up and running quickly. I was also looking to try and learn a bit of Python. So, after a couple months of hacking away at a program that works for Mac, Windows and Linux (massively helped by [PySimpleGUI](https://www.pysimplegui.org/)) I think it is probably ready to see if anyone else could make use of it.

The [readme](https://github.com/rootisgod/MultiManage#readme) on this GitHub repo should explain the general setup in more detail, but, here is a picture of the GUI. It lets you create and manage instances without having to drop down to the command line. I hope someone finds it useful!
