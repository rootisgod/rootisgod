I’m a big believer in using books to deepen knowledge of a subject. I also do love videos and find them a great way to initially learn a subject and get up to speed on something quickly, but books fill in the gaps, and get into ‘real-world’ details, that a video can understandably gloss over in an effort to show a ‘happy path’.

The books below are the ones I have found most value from over the years. Some are pretty old but the concepts are still very relevant and explain the topic in a way I haven’t seen bettered. I’ll try give a wide range of topics and hopefully help someone out there. 

## Paid Book Resources

### Subscription Based Book Learning

#### O’Reilly Learning Safari

I recommend trying out Learning Safari by O’Reilly. It is expensive, but it gives access to almost all books available in the technical world! Try and get it on thanksgiving Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals. The big problem is you can never own the books, and in cases like O'Reilly published books, there is no way to even buy an ebook PDF version. You have to get it on Kindle or buy a physical copy. A bit annoying...

#### Packt Library

Packt do a decent £79.99 a year option of access to all their content and also a free ebook token per month. It's unbeatable value but only worth it if you find books worth reading, which can be a bit tough sometimes.

### Outright Ebook Ownership Learning

#### Humble Bundle

The humble bundle can sometimes have very good book bundles (O’Reilly, Manning) and some middling okay books (Packt). Either way, it can be a quick way to get some really very decent books for around £1 a book, and you can't really do better than that.

#### Packt

Despite a bit of a lack of quality, you can buy Packt books for great prices. Definitely worth a look, and sometimes £5 a book in some cases.

#### Manning

Manning do some great books. They don't really do a 'deal a day' but they have constant sales, so not try to buy full price ever! You should be able to get around 40% off at least in most cases.

## Free Book Resources

### Free Community Books

Lots of publishers like Packt, Manning, Apress etc also have a small selection of free books which can be worth looking over before buying something, especially in open source areas like Git and Python.

### Packt Free Learning

Packt has its place and it really does have a massive selection of books, but the quality can very quite wildly. I was, for obvious reasons, interested in their Jekyll book, but it had almost nothing to do with Jekyll! As a little honeypot, they do release a book each day for free. It can be worth checking to see if something decent is available. It adds to your account and so over a little time you can begin to maintain a decent little library. It does flip over at midnight GMT, so be warned, if you have rtouble sleeping then it can be hard to resist checking at 12AM to see what has been selected.

## Recommended Books

Anyway, here are some real recommendations.

### Classics

#### Continuous Delivery

Desktop apps are now the minority. How many websites do you visit vs apps you open? I appreaciate that not many websites roll their own stack, but, if you work in any kind of software industry then this book is actually just super interesting to read and absorb. It's almost philosophical. Software engineering has started to get somewhere I think.

#### Linux Quick Fix Notebook - Peter Harrison

The book that really got me to understand Linux and some core concepts like networking, DNS and general system management. The premise is how to use and setup a Linux machine running Fedora Core v1 (yes, v1!) as a home server for websites, samba shares and things like that. It is fairly old, but it really hasn’t aged massively and should still translate if you can do a little self editing while reading. Some topics are a little redundant (no need to struggle with wiki on Linux now) and it is very definitely pre-cloud, so keep that in mind, but for learning how to do it yourself, it is excellent as an explaining book. Highly recommended!

### Highly Relevant

#### Docker In Practice

Simply superb. Real-world all the way and shows you how to use Docker in ways you didn’t even realise, like piping things into it and getting output (say image resizing or turning documents into PDFs for example). It will really convince that containers are not simply a fad but a real change in how applicationd can be delivered.

### Nature of Code

If you ever wanted to do some cool little graphics or physics style projects, get this. 

### Terraform Up and Running

We tried to use terraform where I work but it just seemed pretty odd. The easy things were easy, but there are always sharp edges and things you can't even consider or know you are doing wrong until you start a real project.
